Hi Team!

enias:
Thanks for getting back to us on the styling issue we had last week. Font colours are so important for productivity.

enias:
I noticed our branded page is off-centered.

enias:
Is there a way to get that fixed?

enias:
I want our brand logo to be centered on the client form.

enias:
I'm not technical so I can't do it in CSS or HTML.

enias:
Thanks again, looking forward to your response!

enias:
Oh, before I forget. Is there a settings to change the font size?
