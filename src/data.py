Hi Team!

enias:
Thanks for getting back to us on the styling issue we had last week. Font colours are so important for productivity.

enias:
I noticed ab.bot being very verbose lately

enias:
Is there a way to decrease the verbosity level?

enias:
I want ab.bot to ignore thank you messages and stop asking our customers to assign messages to threads.

enias:
Our clients are not technical so working with threads is difficult.

enias:
Thanks again, looking forward to your response!

enias:
Oh, before I forget. Is there a settings to change the font size?
